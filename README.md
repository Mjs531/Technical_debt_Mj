# Technical_debt_Mj

There are some test findings which i have made as low prio and moved on 
  -The trapbuffer only captures the 1st four traps but requirment was to capture latest four traps
  Cause :
  Timeline 
To meet one requirement one process was moved via adapter layer which is not captured in the SW document
  -The changes are documented in the email but not captured in the SW document.
  Cause :
  Competency as its not clear how to docuemnt the adapater changes
In the leagcy project there are bugs identified in the project which were decided not to fix becuse of timeline and possible neagtive effects/late changes 
  -Repeat of fucntinal test etc 
Cause :
  Late driver/SW changes risk is more
